# healthapi.py

This module computes a **normalized health score** (0‚Äì100) for a given country using public health indicators.  
It helps estimate the quality of healthcare in a given location.

---

## Purpose

Access to quality healthcare is an essential factor for comparing cities globally.  
Since most health data is country-level, we use the best available national indicators.

---

## Data Source

- **API**: World Bank Health Indicators (via RapidAPI)
- **Input**: ISO country code (e.g., `"FR"`)
- **Indicators Used**:
    - Life expectancy at birth
    - Infant mortality rate
    - Health expenditure per capita

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Fetches all relevant indicators for the specified country.
2. Each indicator is **normalized to a score between 0 and 100**:
    - Higher life expectancy ‚Üí higher score
    - Lower infant mortality ‚Üí higher score (inverted)
    - Higher health expenditure ‚Üí higher score
3. Applies **weights** to reflect importance:
    - Life expectancy ‚Üí 50%
    - Infant mortality ‚Üí 30%
    - Health expenditure ‚Üí 20%
4. Final output is a **weighted average** health score:
    - **100** = excellent healthcare
    - **0** = poor healthcare or missing data
